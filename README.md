# Prediction of Disease Outbreaks 🌐🤖

Welcome to the **Prediction of Disease Outbreaks** project repository! This repository is part of the AICTE Internship on AI: Transformative Learning with TechSaksham, a joint CSR initiative by Microsoft & SAP. The project leverages Machine Learning to predict potential disease outbreaks using health-related datasets. 🚀

---

## 📌 Features
- 🔍 **Data Analysis**: Comprehensive analysis of health datasets.
- 📈 **Machine Learning Models**:
  - **Diabetes Prediction**
  - **Heart Disease Prediction**
  - **Parkinson's Disease Prediction**
- 🌐 **Web Application**: User-friendly interface for predicting diseases based on user inputs.

---

## 📊 Datasets Used
We used the following datasets:
- **Diabetes Dataset** (`diabetes.csv`)
- **Heart Disease Dataset** (`heart.csv`)
- **Parkinson's Dataset** (`parkinsons.csv`)

Each dataset has been preprocessed and analyzed to ensure accurate predictions.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Models
Three different models were trained using the datasets:
1. **Diabetes Prediction**
   - Training Notebook: `diabetes.ipynb`
   - Model File: `diabetes_model.sav`

2. **Heart Disease Prediction**
   - Training Notebook: `heart.ipynb`
   - Model File: `heart_model.sav`

3. **Parkinson's Disease Prediction**
   - Training Notebook: `parkinsons.ipynb`
   - Model File: `parkinsons_model.sav`
